# Audio Investigation
----------

We investigate the origin of 10 different types of sounds obtained from NYC microphones and attempt to form an appropriate classification model. Our dataset obtained
contains both sound amplitudes and melodies, which we utilize in our models. We implemented dimensionality reduction via PCA to reduce noise from the dataset, 
and implement a logistic regression, neural network, support vector machine, and ultimately convolutional neural network. Examining both the test and training
accuracy, we determine that the convulotional neural network developed forms the best classification model for sound amplitude and melodies.


The entire code can be found in the jupyter notebook attached, featuring the various models and their respective results.
